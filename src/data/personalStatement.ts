    'I have always been curious about the world around me. It fascinates me to understand what happens behind the scenes, the inner workings and the design of everyday things. I am an autodidact engineer; my knowledge comes from books, online materials, people and life experiences.<br/>I was born in Russia and relocated to an Israeli Kibbutz with my family, where I gained my first working experience at 14. I started thinking about my career interest after finishing my IDF (Israel Defense Forces) mandatory service in 2011. I knew I liked building things, so I began working as a mechanical engineer and welder in an industrial food machinery plant. This position exposed me to mechanical and electronic engineering. Then, I discovered an interest in computing and enrolled in a software development course at Sella College, Israel. I started my first software engineering position shortly after taking advanced courses such as Cloud, Linux, Big Data and Profiling, finishing the course with honours.<br/> After a few years in the IT industry, I started lecturing Design Patterns for an evening course at Sella College. In addition, as part of my role, I began consulting Israeli tech startups, working in short time frames on technical or architectural problems remotely and on-site.<br/>At the same time, I wanted to extend my knowledge beyond practical applications, so I enrolled in the BSc Computer Science course at the Open University of Israel while continuing to work full-time. Then, in 2017, I relocated to London and transferred my studies to Birkbeck, University of London as a part-time course.<br/>While studying, I joined a startup as a Software Engineer and naturally progressed to Tech Lead, CTO, and, recently, Principle Engineer. I built an engineering function of more than 30 engineers from scratch, aligning technical deliveries to company objectives. This role taught me a lot about engineering, data science, leadership, business, management, and finance. My current position as a technical leader includes mentorship, setting technical and architectural direction, technology evaluation, and applied research.<br/>In Jul 2022, I graduated with 1st Class Honours in BSc Computing at Birkbeck, an almost eight-year endeavour since I started my academic journey. I am eager to challenge myself further intellectually. I like programming and understanding what happens behind the scenes while I write software. I plan to develop my knowledge and expertise in programming languages by undertaking a PhD research. In addition, the idea of experimentation and research of the unknown fascinates me. So far, I have combined my studies while working full-time, but I am looking to move fully into academic research in the future.<br/>I am fluent in English, Hebrew and Russian and learning Greek. I am a quick learner, a creative problem solver, knowledge-driven, and a technology enthusiast. I learn and practice music, yoga, philosophy, gardening, and meditation in my spare time.'
