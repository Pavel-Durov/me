# Summary

I am an autodidact software engineer with experience scaling and leading businesses from zero to 50 engineers. I am passionate about Open Source, Compilers, Linux, Distributed Systems and Software Architecture.

I am a quick learner, a creative problem solver and a knowledge-driven technology enthusiast. I believe in a no-blame culture, direct feedback and accountability. I strive towards efficiency but I’m not a fanatic, I see myself as a realist with an optimistic point of view. More about my engineering philosophy can be found [here](https://p3ld3v.dev/engineering-philosophy).
